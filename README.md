# Sign-Language-Interpreter
A Machine Learning Project

Our project is a pioneering machine learning endeavor focusing on sign detection using unsupervised learning and SSD deep learning techniques. Developed with Tensorflow, OpenCV, LabelImg, os, gTTS, and other libraries, it aims to create a sign language translator. 

This groundbreaking technology will bridge communication gaps for the deaf and mute, enabling seamless interactions with the hearing community. Our goal is to alleviate loneliness and depression within the deaf population, fostering inclusion and understanding.
